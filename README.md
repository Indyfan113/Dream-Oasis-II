\## General Simulation System and Artificial Intelligence System feat. Both Bots/Agents and Users/Operators/Humans.

System for both Operators/Users and Agents/Bots alike;

Inspiration based off of the general simulation system from the novel 'Ready Player One'.

\#As well as too many to name Books, Films, Comics, Fiction, Science-Fiction, Science-Fact, and the Real and the Unreal.



\## "This system design grew out of A Love of Gaming, Statistics, and most importantly, Real Life, The Mind and The Imaginal".



\## System is intended both for both Simulation(s) and Artificial Intelligence Agency.
